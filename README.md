Spam isn’t a new word to most of us; it’s one of the oldest and worst in the digital marketing world. Who among us hasn’t received unwanted spam emails like, “You’ve won $5,000,000” or “Your dream job is waiting for you for $250?” Spam letters are frequently sent via spoofed email accounts and may include explicit or illegal content.

The junk mails frequently employ scare tactics, contain mistakes and false information, and are sent in bulk by a fake email sender.


## How to stop getting spam emails
If spam might be dangerous, you likely want to know how to stop junk mail for good. Unfortunately, you can’t permanently stop spam emails. The only thing you can do is manage it.

In an ideal world, a properly working spam solution would function this way: all of the emails you want show up in your inbox, all of the emails you don’t want are in your junk folder. And if we could rely on that being 100% accurate all the time, then we’d be done. Because honestly, you would never look at your junk folder.

Unfortunately, things aren’t that simple. Sometimes, spam makes it into your inbox, and sometimes legitimate email gets filtered into your junk folder.
